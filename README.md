Digital Yard Sale files

Moving usually brings with it a whole lot of giving things away and selling things, often in the form of a yard sale or way, way too many Craigslist postings. 

These files are for a simple digital-yard-sale site -- nothing fancy, just a little Javascript, some HTML and CSS. 

The data come from a Google spreadsheet, so this uses Tabletop.js (included in repo) to read data from your own spreadsheet. Edit line 4 of js/moving.js to use your own data.
