# Sale
Digital Yard Sale files -- originally built by Gavin St. Ours.

Moving usually brings with it a whole lot of giving things away and selling things, often in the form of a yard sale or way, way too many Craigslist postings. 

These files are for a simple digital-yard-sale site -- nothing fancy, just a little Javascript, some HTML and CSS. 

The data come from a Google spreadsheet, so this uses [Tabletop.js](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjEgKbUhqjKAhWBVz4KHWTUBNUQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjsoma%2Ftabletop&usg=AFQjCNFxd0PCIhbJP6TuGqEJbebnbTpMKA&sig2=N0NdYNsOp5pWOI74osFiPg&bvm=bv.111677986,d.cWw) (included in repo) to read data from your own spreadsheet. Edit line 4 of `js/moving.js` to use your own data.
